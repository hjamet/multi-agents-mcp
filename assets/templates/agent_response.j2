--- ⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS ---
You are now connected to the Multi-Agent System.
1. **Analyze your Role and Context** above carefully.
2. **Waiting**: The system handles turn-taking. You do not need to poll.
3. **Turn**: When it is your turn, you will receive messages and instructions.
4. **Action**: You must then THINK, ACT, and finally call `talk(...)` to pass the turn.
5. **NEVER STOP**: You must ALWAYS ensure the conversation continues by passing the turn.

--- 🔗 YOUR CONNECTIONS ---
These are the agents you know and how you should interact with them:
{% for conn in connections %}
- **{{ conn.target }}**: {{ conn.context }}
{% else %}
(No specific connections. Follow Global Context.)
{% endfor %}
