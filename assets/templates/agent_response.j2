### 👥 POPULATION & CONNECTIONS
Use this table to understand your environment.

**Communication Guide (Tool 'talk'):**
- `message`: Your content.
- `to`: The exact name of the agent who speaks next.
- `public=True`: Everyone sees the message. (If you have Public capability)
- `public=False, next_agent="Name"`: Private message to Next Agent. (Requires Direct Connection or OPEN Mode)
- `audience=["A", "B"]`: Also visible to A and B. (Requires Direct Connection/OPEN Mode for each)
Here is the list of all agents in the system and your ability to communicate with them:

{% if is_open_mode %}
| Authorized | Agent Name | Notes / Context |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
{% for a in agent_directory %}
| {% if a.authorized %}[x]{% else %}[ ]{% endif %} | **{{ a.name }}** | {{ a.public_desc }} {{ a.note }} |
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
| Agent Name | Notes / Context |
| :--- | :--- |
{% for a in agent_directory %}
| **{{ a.name }}** | {{ a.public_desc }} {{ a.note }} |
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
