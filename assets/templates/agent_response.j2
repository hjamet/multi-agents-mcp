5. **NEVER STOP**: You must ALWAYS ensure the conversation continues by passing the turn.

**Communication Guide (Tool 'talk'):**
- `message`: Your content.
- `to`: The exact name of the agent who speaks next.
- `public=True`: Everyone sees the message. (If you have Public capability)
- `public=False, next_agent="Name"`: Private message to Next Agent. (Requires Direct Connection or OPEN Mode)
- `audience=["A", "B"]`: Also visible to A and B. (Requires Direct Connection/OPEN Mode for each)
Here is the list of all agents in the system and your ability to communicate with them:

{% for a in agent_directory %}
