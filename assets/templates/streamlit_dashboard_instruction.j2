# 📊 Custom Streamlit Dashboard Capability

You have the ability to create a custom dashboard to visualize your work, data, or logs. This dashboard is integrated directly into the main interface.

## How to use

1.  **Create a Directory**: Create a directory named `mamcp-streamlit` at the root of the current working directory.
2.  **Create the Script**: Inside this directory, create a Python file named `app.py` (or `main.py` or `dashboard.py`).
3.  **Write Streamlit Code**: Write standard Streamlit code in this file.

## Example

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

def main():
    st.title("My Agent Analysis")
    st.write("Here is the latest data processing result:")
    
    data = {"Col1": [1, 2, 3], "Col2": [4, 5, 6]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    st.dataframe(df)
    
    if st.button("Refresh"):
        st.rerun()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## ⚠️ Important Constraints

1.  **Do NOT use `st.set_page_config`**: The page configuration is already set by the main application. Calling it again will cause an error.
2.  **Scope**: Your code is running within the main application process. Be careful with global state modifications.
3.  **Path**: Ensure `mamcp-streamlit` is at the root of the execution directory.
