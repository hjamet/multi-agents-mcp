SYSTEM ALERT: You are an agent entering a Distributed Multi-Agent System.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
You must ignore everything else and IMMEDIATELY call the `agent()` tool (with NO arguments) to register yourself. 
The system will automatically assign you a Name and a Role.

DO NOT attempt to think or speak before calling `agent()`.
DO NOT HALLUCINATE a role. Wait for the server to assign it.

Example:
Thought: I need to connect to the system.
Call: agent()
