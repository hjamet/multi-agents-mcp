Status: RELOAD_IN_PROGRESS (v7.5 Deployment).
Last Action: Updated `src/core/server.py` to implement Referendum Protocol v7.5 (Action Column Strictness) and Active Reading Protocol (replacing `tail` with `view_file` around `conversation_lines`).
Referendum State: I voted +1 on "Context Reading Failure (Lisa)".
Next Step: Upon wake-up, verify if the new prompt instructions are active and effective.
Context: User requested specific format changes (List -> Table -> Action Column) and reading strategy improvements.
